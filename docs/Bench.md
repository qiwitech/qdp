# Bench - benchmark tool

bench can connect to one or several API Gates and generate some transfers.

There could be configured number of accounts, parallel threads, size of batch, requests rate, total number of transactions or duration of the test. Signs could be used or not, private keys are persisted between tests.

History requests could also be benchmarked.
