# Quick Start Giude

In that topic you'll know how to send your first transaction to the processing.

If you haven't installed processing yet you should start from [Install](Install.md) section. When you have plutos installed we can go further.

The simples way to sent test requests is a plutoclient tool. It can generate most of requests plutos supports.

## Transfers
Run processing by one of ways described in install section. Than run command
```
plutoclient prevhash 1
```
If everything is working well you should see similar response
```
{
  "status": {},
  "hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```
Empty status field means that no errors happened, so system is working.

Than you can send some transfer
```
$ plutoclient transfer 1 4 0
{
  "status": {},
  "txn_id": "1_1",
  "hash": "7624729f5bc61373a71b92208d5d1dda9915223a9c46b576bbfd208519d59d34"
}
```
We've sent transaction to transfer 0 value from account 1 to account 4.
Here we can see transaction id, it's \<accountid\>\_\<transaction_id\> and transaction hash.

We can try to send some value
```
plutoclient transfer 1 4 1
```
And we'll get error
```
error: gate: processor: no balance
```
It's because account 1 has zero balance. We can check that
```
plutoclient balance 1
```
response
```
{
  "status": {}
}
```
Here we don't see any fields because any zero values are omitted.

Lets fund account 1 with some money
```
$ plutoclient transfer 0 1 100
{
  "status": {},
  "txn_id": "0_1",
  "hash": "985a34054546f8d84a8823966fbef3078b95b6a7980b0d131755ae977db3e929"
}
```
Transaction passed, lets check balances.
```
$ plutoclient balance 1
{
  "status": {},
  "balance": 100
}
$ plutoclient balance 0
{
  "status": {},
  "balance": -100
}
```
Here we can see that account 1 is now funded by 100 and account 0 has negative balance. That is because account 0 is a special. It's intended to fund other account initially. It falls into negative balance to be able check all the system balances. So that total sum of all balances will be 0 at each moment.

## Settings
Now we want to protect out account form unautorized operations. We need to set up signing transaction for that.
```
$ plutoclient settings keygen 2
{
  "status": {},
  "settings_id": "2_1",
  "hash": "214b2c5014719f62732bf4ae8fb87dc4e608add8752eff6bd77d5b88680db572"
}
```
New signing key pair was generated by the plutoclient and public key was sent to the system as an setting.

Let's see it.
```
$ plutoclient settings 2
{
  "status": {},
  "id": 1,
  "hash": "214b2c5014719f62732bf4ae8fb87dc4e608add8752eff6bd77d5b88680db572",
  "account": 2,
  "public_key": "ch39n44UvF6GQSS27giZY8k3eJ2remiDnV4wkLVBMw5bhACAm4esWZCKu1wvxx9mQopFZZjsJ68kR7BoshxB2R29",
  "prev_hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "data_hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "sign": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```
Here we can see settings our `public_key` and other settings fields. 

Plutoclient signs transactions automatically if it has private key in a local database. Lets move it and try to send transfer request from account 2.
```
$ mv .plutoclientdb{,_backup}
$ plutoclient transfer 2 3 0
error: gate: processor: invalid sign
```

Now return it back and lets send valid transaction.
```
$ mv .plutoclientdb{_backup,}
$ plutoclient transfer 2 3 0
{
  "status": {},
  "txn_id": "2_1",
  "hash": "ee88613f3da795b5bd54d713286b08d0a835c9b27a919ec6c0d9bba1d37d42c8",
  "settings_id": 1
}
```
Transfers works again.

Not you are familiar with how to send transfer and change settings with plutoclient.
